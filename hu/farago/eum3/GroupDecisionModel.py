Unravelling "Unravelling BDM's group decision model"
===========================================================================

This code attempts to replicate the model described by Sholz, Calbert and Smith
(2011) [http://jtp.sagepub.com/content/23/4/510], which in turn is a replication
of Bruce Bueno De Mesquita's group decision / expected utility model.   

The code consists of an Actor class, which stores actor-level variables and 
calculation methods, and a Model class to store the actors and streamline the 
model execution.

Some, but not all, the variable names correspond to their names in the paper.

Much of the model deals with pairwise interactions; in the following code, 
'alter' generally refers to the actor's counterpart in such an interaction, 
often designated with a subscript j in the paper.
